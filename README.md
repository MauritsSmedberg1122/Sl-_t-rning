# Throw Dice

## Description

My program is a game where the user uses mathematics with the white dices to get the result from the blue and red dice together. 

## Languages

- Python
A main component of my program is the 'random' module.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+

## Installation

This project is tested on Python 3.7+. In order to install it, please visit (https://www.python.org/downloads/)[this link].

In order to run the game you need to clone the repository using the following command:

cmd
    git clone https://github.com/MauritsSmedberg1122/Throw_dice.git

The game is started by running the python file 'throw_dice.py'.

## Example run

An example run of the program looks like this:

```Welcome to roll a dice!
In this game, your task is to first roll the dice. Then, with the help of
mathematics
(plus, minus, times and divided)
you should get the result to the result of blue and white dice together.
Good luck!
I roll the dices
Blue dice: 3
Red dice: 4
White dices: [4, 4, 6, 3, 6]
To win you should get the result: 34
Now it's time to start calculating! Input your guess:
4+4*6-3/6
Your answer was 7.5
You lost!
If you want to play again type 'Yes'
```
